Web Scraping and Predictive Modeling for British Airways Customer Reviews
Overview
In this project, we will use web scraping to gather customer review data for British Airways, and use it to gain insights into customer behaviour. We will then build a predictive model to understand the factors that influence buying behaviour.

Tools and Technologies
Python
BeautifulSoup
Selenium
Pandas
Scikit-learn
Task 1: 
Web Scraping
To begin, we will use BeautifulSoup and Selenium to scrape customer review data from the British Airways website. We will then clean and preprocess the data to prepare it for analysis.

Task 2: 
Data Analysis
Next, we will analyze the customer review data to uncover insights about customer behaviour. We will perform sentiment analysis and emotion analysis to understand how customers feel about their experience with British Airways.
Predictive Modeling
Finally, we will build a predictive model to understand the factors that influence buying behaviour. We will use scikit-learn to train a machine learning algorithm and evaluate its performance through cross-validation. We will then create a visualisation to interpret how each variable contributes to the model.

Conclusion
By completing these tasks, we hope to gain a deeper understanding of customer behaviour and develop strategies to improve customer satisfaction and increase bookings for British Airways.
